_Rectangular Approximation Method_
------
__Description__  
This program is used to calculate the Left, Middle, and Right Rectangular Approximation Methods.  
Also known in Calculus as LRAM, MRAM, and RRAM.  
  
A function is provided to generate the y values based on a set number of steps which translate to incremented x values.
The larger the number of steps, the smaller the increment and the more y values generated; ultimately increasing accuracy.
